Project Conclusions: Swiggy Restaurant Data Analysis

This document outlines the main conclusions drawn from the analysis of Swiggy’s restaurant data across various Indian cities. The goal of the analysis was to understand patterns in ratings, delivery time, cost, and restaurant distribution based on location.

1. Ratings vs Location

Bangalore, Pune, and Hyderabad generally have the highest average restaurant ratings.

Tier-2 cities show more inconsistency in ratings, which may reflect the presence of newer or less experienced restaurants.

Low-rated restaurants often also have long delivery times and higher costs, indicating a potential impact on customer satisfaction.

2. Delivery Time Insights

Metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi have longer average delivery times, likely due to high population density and traffic congestion.

Smaller cities like Indore and Kochi offer faster delivery times, which may enhance customer experience.

Fast delivery seems to contribute to better ratings overall.

3. Cost Trends

Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore show the highest average cost for two people, often over ₹600.

Southern cities tend to be more affordable for similar food categories.

A slight negative correlation exists between cost and rating—spending more does not always result in a better-rated experience.

4. Location-Based Distribution

Restaurant density is highest in commercial or IT hubs like Koramangala (Bangalore), Andheri (Mumbai), and Hitech City (Hyderabad).

Some areas were identified as underserved, where fewer restaurants are available despite large populations—these could represent growth opportunities.

Additional Observations

Multi-cuisine restaurants tend to receive slightly better ratings, possibly because they appeal to a wider audience.

Street food and local cuisine vendors are generally affordable but still receive high ratings, indicating strong local support.

City-wide delivery averages can be skewed by heavily congested or high-demand zones.

Business Implications

New restaurants may benefit by targeting areas with high demand but low existing restaurant presence.

Cloud kitchens are well-suited for high-density, high-delay areas, as they can optimize delivery logistics.

Investing in faster delivery networks in metro areas could help improve customer retention and satisfaction.

Future Scope

Incorporating time-based data (e.g., peak delivery hours or weekends) could provide a more dynamic analysis.

Performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews would offer deeper insights into restaurant performance.

A comparison with Zomato or other delivery platforms could provide competitive insights and highlight operational differences.

Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates the value of data-driven insights in the food delivery industry. By examining trends in cost, delivery time, ratings, and geographic presence, businesses can make smarter decisions about where and how to operate. It also opens up opportunities for optimization and innovation in both restaurant management and delivery logistics.
